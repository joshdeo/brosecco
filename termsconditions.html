        <br>
        Welcome to the Internet site of THE BROSÉ GROUP INC (the "Website"), operated by THE BROSÉ GROUP INC Marketing
        Company Ltd.(referred to herein as the "Company", "we", "us," or "our").
        <br>
        PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS ("TERMS OF SERVICE"), WHICH COMPRISE
        AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN USERS OF THE WEBSITE AND THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.CA (THIS "AGREEMENT"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
        WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE WEBSITE OR ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS
        CONTAINED ON THE WEBSITE. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE YOUR AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY EACH OF THE
        TERMS SET FORTH BELOW. THE TERMS OF SERVICE MAY BE UPDATED BY THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.CA FROM TIME TO TIME WITH OR
        WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE INDICATES ACCEPTANCE OF ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE TERMS
        OF SERVICE.
        <br>
        <br>
        How We Operate
        <br>
        The Company holds a Licence to Represent Manufacturer #57303 issued by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of
        Ontario (the "AGCO") for its representation of each of the vintners depicted on the Website, and carries on
        business to the public as "THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.ca". We offer for sale, and deliver wine to you purchased through
        the Consignment Program operated by the Private Ordering provisions of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario
        ("LCBO"), and we or our affiliates are authorized by the LCBO as a consignment agent.
        <br>
        <br>
        LCBO Guidelines define our role and the LCBO´s expectations. As a Manufacturer´s Representative or agent, we do
        not "sell" wine. Rather, the LCBO regards you to be its customer. We are the intermediary which processes the
        sale of wine from the LCBO to you. "Processes" means that we represent our manufacturers and assist in the
        transaction of your purchase from the LCBO. In some cases, information is requested by the LCBO from us for the
        submission of orders and the LCBO is bound by the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as is
        THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.ca. Should you ever feel the LCBO has used this information for purposes other than the
        completion of a sale, please notify THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.ca. In particular, if you are contracted by the LCBO
        with questions about your purchase history, you are under no obligation to respond and we ask that you notify us
        immediately.
        <br>
        <br>
        The wine prices shown on the Website are inclusive of the LCBO sale price, licensee discounts and markups and
        fees charged by THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.ca. The LCBO sale price is available upon request. All wine is held by the
        LCBO in its consignment warehouse until your order is placed. Wine is not available directly from THE BROSÉ
        GROUP INC.ca nor does THE BROSÉ GROUP INC.ca have any liquor on its premises excepting previously arranged
        pick-ups and products in transit.
        <br>
